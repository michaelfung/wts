# WongTaiSin (黃大仙) Service Project


This project aims to provide a network infrastructre for remote access to large number of MCU, without the
need to setup firewall port forwarding or DDNS.

## Test Drive

The project is in infancy stage. But you can test drive by:

1. Download the MCU emulator.

2. Ask for a MCU ID and install the emulator with the MCU ID.

3. Power on the MCU.

4. Go to the temporary web site to register and control the MCU.
